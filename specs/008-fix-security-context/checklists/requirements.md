# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Security Context for OpenShift Compatibility

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-16

All quality criteria have been met. The specification:
- Clearly defines the problem (runAsUser: 1000 violates restricted-v2 policy)
- Provides testable functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010)
- Includes measurable success criteria without implementation details
- Defines scope boundaries appropriately
- Identifies key assumptions and dependencies
- Describes user scenarios that can be tested independently
- Contains no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

## Notes

The specification is ready for the next phase. Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
