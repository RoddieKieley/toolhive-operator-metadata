# Specification Quality Checklist: Upgrade ToolHive Operator to v0.4.2

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED

This specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Validation Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec focuses entirely on WHAT needs to be updated (version numbers, CRD inclusion) and WHY (access to v0.4.2 features, MCPGroup functionality). No implementation details about HOW to perform the updates are included.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 18 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Each requirement clearly states what MUST change (e.g., "CATALOG_TAG, BUNDLE_TAG, and INDEX_TAG all default to v0.4.2").

3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. They focus on user-verifiable outcomes (e.g., "operator pod runs with v0.4.2 images") rather than implementation details.

4. **Acceptance Scenarios**: Each of the 4 user stories includes specific Given/When/Then scenarios that can be independently tested.

5. **Edge Cases**: Five relevant edge cases are identified covering potential failure scenarios.

6. **Scope**: Clearly bounded with 8 items in scope and 9 items explicitly out of scope.

7. **Assumptions**: Nine assumptions documented, all reasonable for a version upgrade task.

No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous and complete.
