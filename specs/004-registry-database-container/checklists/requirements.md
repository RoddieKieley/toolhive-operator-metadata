## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Initial Validation (2025-10-10)**:

All checklist items passed on first review. The specification:

1. **Content Quality**: Successfully maintains focus on WHAT and WHY without diving into HOW. Uses business-friendly language describing operator deployment scenarios without technical implementation details.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 13 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No clarification markers needed - all aspects of index image creation, validation, and CatalogSource updates are clearly specified based on the feature description and operator-registry documentation patterns.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
   - SC-001, SC-002: Time-based metrics (2 minutes)
   - SC-003: Percentage-based validation coverage (100%)
   - SC-004: Completeness metric (100% of examples)
   - SC-005: Quality metric (zero mixed-format images)
   - SC-006: Compatibility verification (no workarounds needed)

4. **Feature Readiness**: User stories are prioritized (P1, P2), independently testable, and cover all deployment scenarios (modern OpenShift, legacy OpenShift, format separation, documentation updates). Edge cases address error scenarios and constraint violations.

**Status**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` without requiring `/speckit.clarify`.
