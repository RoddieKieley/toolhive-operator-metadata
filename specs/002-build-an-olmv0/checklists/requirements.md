# Specification Quality Checklist: OLMv0 Bundle Container Image Build System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation checks have passed successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Notes

- Specification successfully maintains dual-system requirements (OLMv0 + OLMv1)
- All functional requirements are testable without implementation knowledge
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes rather than technical metrics
- Edge cases appropriately identify potential failure modes
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are well-defined within the OLM bundle specification context
