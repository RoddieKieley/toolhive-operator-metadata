# Specification Quality Checklist: Custom Container Image Naming

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses entirely on developer needs (build flexibility, custom registries) without mentioning implementation (Makefile variables, environment variables). Written in business terms about development workflows.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No clarification markers - all requirements are clear and specific
   - Each FR is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by building catalog with custom registry)
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (SC-003: "100% of existing targets", SC-005: "27 test combinations")
   - Success criteria avoid implementation details (focused on developer experience and outcomes)
   - 5 user stories with 3 acceptance scenarios each = comprehensive coverage
   - 7 edge cases identified covering validation, conflicts, and precedence
   - Scope clearly bounded to override mechanism for 3 image types × 4 components
   - Dependencies list existing specs and assumptions document developer knowledge

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - All 12 functional requirements map to user story acceptance scenarios
   - User stories progress from critical (P1: registry/org overrides) to nice-to-have (P3: partial overrides)
   - Success criteria define measurable outcomes (build time parity, zero regression, combination coverage)
   - No implementation leakage - specification focuses on capabilities, not mechanisms

## Notes

The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`. No updates required.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization (P1 for essential registry/org control, P2 for naming flexibility, P3 for partial overrides)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Technology-agnostic success criteria
- Well-defined scope and boundaries
