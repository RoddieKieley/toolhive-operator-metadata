# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Scorecard Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on what scorecard validation must accomplish without prescribing shell commands, specific file paths, or implementation approaches. References to "config.yaml" and "make targets" are necessary functional requirements, not implementation details.

✅ **User value focused**: Clearly articulates why maintainers need scorecard validation (catch errors early, prevent failed deployments, ensure bundle quality).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Uses operator maintainer perspective and plain language. Technical terms (scorecard, CSV, CRD) are necessary domain vocabulary.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are specific and actionable with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 verified by checking config file exists; FR-002 verified by running make target).

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: SC-001 through SC-006 all include specific metrics (2 minutes, 100%, single command, 10 minutes).

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes ("validation completes in under 2 minutes", "bundles pass 100% of tests") without specifying how to achieve them.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios**: Each user story includes Given/When/Then scenarios covering normal and error cases.

✅ **Edge cases**: Six edge cases identified covering missing config, missing tools, network issues, cluster access, and error handling.

✅ **Bounded scope**: Out of Scope section clearly excludes custom tests, CI/CD integration, runtime testing, and automated remediation.

✅ **Dependencies documented**: External (operator-sdk, cluster, images) and internal (bundle generation, existing validation) dependencies listed.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is verifiable and maps to user stories.

✅ **User scenarios complete**: Three prioritized user stories (P1: basic validation, P2: automation, P3: comprehensive coverage) cover the full feature scope with independent test criteria.

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Six success criteria provide clear targets for feature completion (completion time, pass rate, command simplicity, error resolution time).

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains focus on what the system must do without prescribing how (e.g., "System MUST provide a build target" not "Create a Makefile target named scorecard-test using bash commands").

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and actionable
- Strong prioritization of user stories enables MVP delivery (P1) with optional enhancements (P2, P3)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage will inform error handling during implementation
