## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on what the catalog image must do (serve metadata, be deployable, preserve labels) rather than how it's implemented. The only reference to implementation (Containerfile.catalog and opm tooling) is in the context of the problem being solved, not prescribing how to solve it.

✅ **Focused on user value**: All user stories articulate clear value propositions for cluster operators and developers - deployability, validation, compatibility, and performance.

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: The spec uses plain language to describe operator deployment workflows, catalog functionality, and OLM integration without requiring deep Kubernetes expertise.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios, Requirements (FR + Key Entities), and Success Criteria sections are all fully populated with concrete details.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**: The spec contains zero clarification markers. All requirements are stated definitively based on the user's clear directive to follow the reference implementation pattern.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each FR can be verified:
- FR-001: Check image contains /bin/opm binary
- FR-002: Inspect entrypoint configuration
- FR-004: Compare labels before/after
- FR-010: Measure startup time with/without cache
- etc.

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All SC entries include quantifiable metrics:
- SC-001: 10 seconds to Running state
- SC-002: 500ms query response time
- SC-004: 100% label preservation
- SC-005: Local validation capability

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (pod starts, queries respond, build succeeds) without mentioning Docker, Kubernetes API versions, or specific tooling implementations.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: Each of 4 user stories has 2-3 Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy paths and key variations.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: 6 edge cases listed covering error conditions (missing binaries, invalid YAML, misconfiguration, permission issues, missing dependencies).

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: The "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes catalog metadata changes, custom registry implementations, CatalogSource manifests, OLMv0 support, and CI/CD pipelines.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**:
- Dependencies: opm base image, catalog metadata files, build tools, opm CLI
- Assumptions: OLM installed in clusters, catalog metadata is valid, standard registry-server port usage

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: The user story acceptance scenarios provide testable criteria that map directly to the functional requirements (e.g., US1 scenarios validate FR-001, FR-002, FR-003).

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**:
- P1: Core deployment capability (US1)
- P1: Backward compatibility (US3)
- P2: Pre-deployment validation (US2)
- P3: Performance optimization (US4)

The prioritization ensures the MVP (P1 stories) delivers a functional, compatible executable catalog.

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Each success criterion can be validated:
- SC-001: Deploy and time pod startup
- SC-002: Query and measure response time
- SC-003: Run make catalog-build and check exit code
- SC-004: Label comparison script
- SC-005: Local container run test

✅ **No implementation details leak**: While the spec references "Containerfile.catalog" and "opm tooling", these are problem domain terminology (the files/tools that need updating), not solution prescriptions. The spec doesn't dictate base image versions, build commands, or code structure.

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization with P1 focusing on core deployability and compatibility
2. Well-defined constraints preventing scope creep (preserve existing metadata, no custom implementations)
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage for error scenarios
4. Measurable success criteria with specific numeric targets

**No blockers identified** - specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
