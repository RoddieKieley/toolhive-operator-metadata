# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix OperatorHub Availability

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All 16 items validated successfully

### Content Quality Assessment

1. ✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on user outcomes and observable behaviors. References to "gRPC" and "OLM v1" are external protocol/format names, not implementation choices.
2. ✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate administrator/developer needs and business value.
3. ✅ **Non-technical clarity**: Written for cluster administrators and developers, avoids internal system architecture details.
4. ✅ **Complete sections**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

5. ✅ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are concrete and specific. The issue is well-defined with specific registry locations, namespaces, and expected behaviors.
6. ✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified through inspection or deployment testing:
   - FR-001-003: Observable in OperatorHub UI
   - FR-004-007: Verifiable via file inspection
   - FR-008-012: Testable via deployment and resource queries
7. ✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (30 seconds, count "(1)", 100%, 1 minute).
8. ✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-observable outcomes (UI display, deployment success, resource creation).
9. ✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3-4 Given/When/Then scenarios covering the happy path.
10. ✅ **Edge cases identified**: 5 edge cases documented covering deployment variations, image failures, and metadata issues.
11. ✅ **Bounded scope**: Limited to catalog metadata fixes, registry location updates, and example file corrections. Does not expand into new features.
12. ✅ **Dependencies documented**: Internal dependencies (Spec 006, catalog.yaml, Makefile) and external dependencies (OpenShift, quay.io, opm) are listed.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

13. ✅ **Acceptance criteria clarity**: Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories or edge cases.
14. ✅ **Primary flows covered**: Three independent user stories cover catalog display (P1), registry updates (P2), and namespace configuration (P2).
15. ✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 7 success criteria provide clear pass/fail metrics for the feature.
16. ✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification avoids prescribing how to fix the issue, focuses on what the correct behavior should be.

## Notes

- The specification correctly identifies a display issue (catalog shows no name and 0 operators) and configuration issues (wrong registry, wrong namespace).
- All requirements are specific and actionable without prescribing implementation approach.
- The feature is well-scoped and independently testable.
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.
