# Specification Quality Checklist: Upgrade Toolhive Operator to v0.3.11

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on version upgrade requirements without mentioning specific implementation approaches, tools, or code changes.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate value ("so that the operator metadata repository uses the latest stable version").

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written for maintainers and operators without assuming deep technical knowledge.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present with complete content.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification is complete with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) specify concrete, verifiable conditions.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 5 seconds"
- SC-002: "passes validation on first attempt"
- SC-004: "100% success rate"
- SC-006: "within 30 minutes"
- SC-008: "zero v0.2.17 references remaining"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (builds succeed, validation passes, tests pass) without implementation details.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 3 user stories has 3 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 4 edge cases documented covering cache issues, image availability, breaking changes, and rollback.

✅ **Scope bounded**: "Out of Scope" section clearly excludes version upgrades beyond v0.3.11, code modifications, architecture changes, etc.

✅ **Assumptions documented**: 7 assumptions listed covering image availability, API compatibility, OpenShift compatibility, and manifest availability.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Functional requirements with acceptance criteria**: All 15 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST update config/base/params.env to reference ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/operator:v0.3.11").

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 3 prioritized user stories cover configuration updates (P1), validation (P2), and documentation (P3) in logical dependency order.

✅ **Measurable outcomes aligned**: All 8 success criteria directly map to user stories and functional requirements.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification describes WHAT needs to be updated and WHY, not HOW to implement the changes.

## Notes

✅ **All checklist items PASSED** - Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`

### Strengths

1. Clear version upgrade scope (v0.2.17 → v0.3.11)
2. Well-prioritized user stories enabling incremental delivery
3. Comprehensive coverage of configuration files, validation, and documentation
4. Constitutional compliance explicitly addressed (NFR-001, NFR-002, NFR-003)
5. Rollback capability explicitly required (NFR-005)

### Recommendations for Planning Phase

- Consider creating separate tasks for each configuration file type (params.env, manager.yaml, Makefile)
- Plan validation steps as dependencies for documentation updates
- Include constitutional compliance check as automated task
- Consider creating download/update task for upstream v0.3.11 manifests
