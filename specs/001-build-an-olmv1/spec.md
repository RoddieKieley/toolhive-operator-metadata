# Feature Specification: OLMv1 File-Based Catalog Bundle

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-olmv1`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an OLMv1 bundle for the toolhive-operator. The OLMv1 in this case refers to the Operator Lifecycle Manager v1. Add the required data and files for manifests to add the ability to build a File Based Catalog (FBC) bundle for the Operator Lifecycle Manager v1 as per the documentation at https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs. The bundle metadata should be buildable into a container image using the opm tool. This bundle MUST validate successfully using the operator-sdk tool as per https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/best-practices/common."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Bundle Metadata Creation (Priority: P1)

Platform engineers need to create OLMv1 catalog metadata for the Toolhive Operator so it can be discovered and installed through Operator Lifecycle Manager v1 in Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters.

**Why this priority**: Without the basic catalog metadata files, the operator cannot be registered or discovered in OLMv1 systems. This is the foundation for all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating the catalog metadata files, validating them with `opm validate`, and verifying they contain all required schemas (olm.package, olm.channel, olm.bundle) and delivers a valid FBC structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the repository contains existing Kustomize manifests in config/, **When** a platform engineer adds FBC metadata files, **Then** the catalog directory structure includes separate subdirectories for package metadata with valid olm.package, olm.channel, and olm.bundle schemas
2. **Given** FBC metadata files exist, **When** running `opm validate` on the catalog directory, **Then** validation passes without errors
3. **Given** the catalog metadata is complete, **When** inspecting the olm.bundle schema, **Then** it references the correct container image location and includes all required properties (packageName, version)

---

### User Story 2 - Container Image Build (Priority: P2)

Platform engineers need to build the FBC metadata into a container image using the opm tool so it can be deployed to container registries and consumed by OLMv1 clusters.

**Why this priority**: After creating metadata files (P1), the next essential step is packaging them into a distributable container image format required by OLMv1.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `opm` build commands on the catalog metadata, producing a container image, and verifying the image contains the expected catalog layers and can be pushed to a registry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid FBC metadata files exist, **When** a platform engineer runs the opm build command, **Then** a container image is created containing the catalog metadata
2. **Given** a built catalog container image, **When** the image is inspected, **Then** it contains the catalog directory structure with all metadata files intact
3. **Given** a built catalog image, **When** pushing to a container registry, **Then** the push succeeds and the image is accessible for OLMv1 consumption

---

### User Story 3 - Operator SDK Validation (Priority: P3)

Platform engineers need to validate the bundle using operator-sdk to ensure it meets Operator Framework best practices and quality standards before publishing.

**Why this priority**: While validation is critical for production readiness, it's performed after the bundle is created and built. It ensures quality but doesn't block initial creation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `operator-sdk bundle validate` on the bundle directory and verifying all validators pass, including the operatorframework suite.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complete FBC bundle with metadata and manifests, **When** running `operator-sdk bundle validate`, **Then** all required validators pass without errors
2. **Given** the bundle specifies a minimum Kubernetes version, **When** validating with specific k8s-version parameters, **Then** compatibility checks pass for supported versions
3. **Given** validation passes, **When** running operator-sdk scorecard tests, **Then** the bundle meets Operator Framework quality standards

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Channel Support (Priority: P4)

Platform engineers need to define multiple release channels (e.g., stable, candidate, fast) in the catalog metadata so users can choose their desired update cadence and stability level.

**Why this priority**: Multi-channel support is an advanced feature that enhances flexibility but is not required for initial OLMv1 adoption. A single default channel suffices for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding multiple olm.channel schemas to the catalog metadata, validating the structure, and verifying each channel defines appropriate upgrade edges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the catalog metadata exists with one channel, **When** a platform engineer adds additional channel definitions, **Then** each channel has unique entries and upgrade paths
2. **Given** multiple channels are defined, **When** validating with opm, **Then** all channels pass validation and define valid version sequences
3. **Given** channels with different stability levels exist, **When** the catalog is deployed, **Then** users can subscribe to their preferred channel

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the bundle image reference is invalid or inaccessible?
- How does the system handle missing required schemas (olm.package, olm.channel, olm.bundle)?
- What happens when semantic versions are malformed or conflict between channels?
- How does validation behave when minimum Kubernetes version is not specified?
- What happens when building the catalog image without required CRD manifests?
- How does the system handle incompatible Kubernetes versions during validation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The repository MUST include a catalog directory structure containing FBC metadata files organized by package
- **FR-002**: The catalog metadata MUST include exactly one olm.package schema per package defining package name, description, default channel, and icon
- **FR-003**: The catalog metadata MUST include at least one olm.channel schema defining channel entries and upgrade edges
- **FR-004**: The catalog metadata MUST include one or more olm.bundle schemas specifying bundle image location and required properties (packageName, version)
- **FR-005**: Bundle versions MUST follow semantic versioning format (major.minor.patch)
- **FR-006**: The bundle MUST specify a minimum Kubernetes version in the ClusterServiceVersion manifest
- **FR-007**: The catalog metadata MUST be buildable into a container image using the opm tool
- **FR-008**: The bundle MUST pass validation when running `operator-sdk bundle validate` with the operatorframework suite
- **FR-009**: The catalog structure MUST support both JSON and YAML file formats for metadata
- **FR-010**: Bundle images referenced in olm.bundle schemas MUST point to valid, accessible container image locations
- **FR-011**: The catalog MUST define unique combinations of schema, package, and name for each entry
- **FR-012**: The package metadata MUST reference the existing CRDs (MCPRegistry, MCPServer) defined in config/crd/

### Key Entities

- **Catalog Package**: Represents the Toolhive Operator as a distributable package containing metadata about available versions, channels, and upgrade paths
- **Channel**: Represents a release track (e.g., stable, candidate) defining which operator versions are available and how upgrades flow between versions
- **Bundle**: Represents a specific installable version of the Toolhive Operator including manifests (CRDs, RBAC, deployment) and metadata
- **Catalog Image**: Container image containing the FBC metadata files, buildable via opm and consumable by OLMv1 clusters

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The catalog metadata validates successfully with zero errors when running `opm validate`
- **SC-002**: The bundle validates successfully with zero errors when running `operator-sdk bundle validate --select-optional suite=operatorframework`
- **SC-003**: Platform engineers can build a catalog container image from the metadata files in under 2 minutes using standard opm commands
- **SC-004**: The built catalog image contains all required schemas (olm.package, olm.channel, olm.bundle) and can be deployed to OLMv1 clusters
- **SC-005**: The bundle passes operator-sdk scorecard tests with a passing score
- **SC-006**: The catalog metadata includes version information for at least the current operator version (v0.2.17)

## Assumptions

- The repository already contains valid Kubernetes manifests in config/ directories that can be referenced by the bundle
- Platform engineers have opm and operator-sdk tools installed and available
- The catalog will initially support a single default channel (additional channels are P4)
- Bundle images will be hosted in the existing ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive registry following current image naming conventions
- The catalog follows OLMv1 FBC format as documented at https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/reference/file-based-catalogs
- Validation is performed before pushing catalog images to production registries

## Dependencies

- Existing CRD manifests in config/crd/ (MCPRegistry, MCPServer)
- Existing RBAC manifests in config/rbac/
- Existing manager deployment manifests in config/manager/
- ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) manifest defining operator metadata and capabilities
- opm tool (Operator Package Manager) for building catalog images
- operator-sdk tool for bundle validation and scorecard testing

## Constraints

- Must comply with OLMv1 File-Based Catalog specification
- Must pass all operator-sdk validation checks
- Catalog metadata must be version-controlled alongside existing manifests
- Bundle images must be immutable (no updates to existing version tags)
- Must support minimum Kubernetes version specified in operator requirements
