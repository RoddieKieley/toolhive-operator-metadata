# Specification Quality Checklist: OLMv1 File-Based Catalog Bundle

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Details:

1. **Content Quality**:
   - Spec focuses on WHAT (catalog metadata, validation) and WHY (OLMv1 distribution)
   - Written from platform engineer perspective without code/implementation
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
   - All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-008 specifies exact validation command)
   - Success criteria include measurable outcomes (SC-001: "zero errors", SC-003: "under 2 minutes")
   - Success criteria are tool/outcome focused, not implementation focused
   - 4 user stories with acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
   - 6 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary cases
   - Clear scope: FBC metadata creation, image building, validation
   - Assumptions and dependencies sections populated

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios (e.g., FR-007 → P2 acceptance scenarios)
   - User stories prioritized P1-P4 covering metadata creation → build → validation → multi-channel
   - Success criteria measurable via opm/operator-sdk commands
   - No language/framework mentions; focuses on catalog schemas and validation outcomes

## Notes

Specification is production-ready. Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.
