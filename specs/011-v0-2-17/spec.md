# Feature Specification: Upgrade Toolhive Operator to v0.3.11

**Feature Branch**: `011-v0-2-17`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "v0.2.17 to v0.3.11. This project has been building out its functionality utilizing the tagged toolhive-operator container image version v0.2.17. The v0.2.17 package release page is at https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/pkgs/container/toolhive%2Foperator/510178764?tag=v0.2.17 which references the ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/operator:v0.2.17 container image url that this project references. This version, v0.2.17, was released about 1 month ago. Just recently a newer version has been released that this project requires an update to use, v0.3.11 at https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/pkgs/container/toolhive%2Foperator/548053212?tag=v0.3.11. This version was released about 4 days ago. To be clear the project is now required to use version v0.3.11 instead of the existing version in use v0.2.17."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Update Configuration Files (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I need to update all configuration files and manifests to reference v0.3.11 so that the operator metadata repository uses the latest stable version of the toolhive-operator.

**Why this priority**: This is the core requirement - updating version references is mandatory and blocks all other work. Without this, the repository continues using outdated v0.2.17 images.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `kustomize build config/base` and `kustomize build config/default` and verifying all image references show v0.3.11 instead of v0.2.17.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** configuration files reference v0.2.17, **When** version update is applied, **Then** all operator image references change to v0.3.11
2. **Given** configuration files reference v0.2.17, **When** version update is applied, **Then** all proxyrunner image references change to v0.3.11
3. **Given** updated configuration files, **When** kustomize builds are executed, **Then** both config/base and config/default build successfully without errors

---

### User Story 2 - Validate Compatibility (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I need to validate that the v0.3.11 upgrade doesn't break existing functionality so that deployments continue working correctly.

**Why this priority**: After updating references, validation ensures the new version is compatible with existing manifests and doesn't introduce regressions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by running `make validate-all` and `make scorecard-test` after version updates are applied.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** updated v0.3.11 configuration, **When** bundle is generated, **Then** bundle validation passes without errors
2. **Given** updated v0.3.11 configuration, **When** scorecard tests run, **Then** all 6 tests (1 basic + 5 OLM) pass successfully
3. **Given** updated v0.3.11 configuration, **When** catalog is built, **Then** OLM catalog validation passes

---

### User Story 3 - Update Documentation (Priority: P3)

As a developer or user, I need documentation to reflect v0.3.11 as the current version so that I understand which version to use and how to upgrade.

**Why this priority**: Documentation updates are important for clarity but don't block functionality. They can be completed after the core upgrade is validated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing all documentation files and verifying examples, quickstart guides, and references mention v0.3.11 instead of v0.2.17.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** README and CLAUDE.md files, **When** version update is documented, **Then** all references to v0.2.17 are updated to v0.3.11
2. **Given** feature specification documents, **When** reviewed, **Then** version-specific examples reflect v0.3.11 where appropriate
3. **Given** validation documentation, **When** updated, **Then** image references in examples show v0.3.11

### Edge Cases

- What happens when generated bundle references old v0.2.17 version due to cached downloads?
- How does the system handle if v0.3.11 container images are not yet pulled locally?
- What happens if v0.3.11 introduces breaking changes that cause validation failures?
- How does the system handle rollback if v0.3.11 proves incompatible?

- **SC-005**: Constitution compliance check passes - both kustomize builds succeed and CRDs remain unchanged
- **SC-006**: Version upgrade completes within 30 minutes from start to validated deployment
- **SC-007**: No manual intervention required during version update process beyond initial version number change
- **SC-008**: Generated manifests reference only v0.3.11 images with zero v0.2.17 references remaining

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Version upgrade MUST NOT modify CRD definitions (constitution principle III)

- **NFR-003**: Version upgrade MUST maintain OpenShift compatibility for both config/base and config/default overlays
- **NFR-004**: Version upgrade MUST NOT require changes to existing deployment workflows or procedures
- **NFR-005**: Rollback to v0.2.17 MUST be possible by reverting version number changes only

## Assumptions

- v0.3.11 container images are publicly available at ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive registry
- v0.3.11 maintains API compatibility with v0.2.17 (no breaking CRD changes)
- v0.3.11 release notes indicate compatibility with existing OpenShift versions (4.15+)
- Cosign installer revert in v0.3.11 (from v4 to v3.10.1) does not affect operator functionality
- Existing bundle and catalog generation processes remain compatible with v0.3.11
- No new CRDs or API versions are introduced in v0.3.11 that require manifest changes
- Downloaded operator manifests for v0.3.11 will be available from upstream release artifacts

## Out of Scope

- Upgrading to versions newer than v0.3.11
- Backporting v0.3.11 features to v0.2.17
- Modifying operator controller code or behavior
- Changing deployment topologies or architectures
- Adding new features beyond version update
- Performance tuning or optimization
- Updating dependencies beyond operator images
- Creating new OLM channels or update paths
